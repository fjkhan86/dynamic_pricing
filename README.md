Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset that includes pricing information for various products. The goal is to clean the data, explore key trends, and build models to predict certain outcomes, such as price based on product features.

Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process, documented in the notebook 01_datacleaning.ipynb, involved the following steps:

Missing Data Handling: Identified and handled missing values by imputing with relevant strategies or removing irrelevant records.
Data Type Conversion: Converted data types for certain columns to ensure compatibility for analysis and modeling.
Outlier Detection and Treatment: Identified and handled outliers using statistical methods to prevent them from skewing the analysis.
Normalization and Standardization: Applied normalization to certain features where necessary to ensure that scales of features do not affect the models.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA, documented in 02_eda.ipynb, provided insights into the data through visualizations and summary statistics:

Summary Statistics: Generated descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and central tendencies of key features.
Visualizations:
Histograms and Box Plots were used to visualize the distribution of numeric variables.
Correlation Heatmaps were employed to explore relationships between different numeric features.
Category-Based Analysis was conducted to compare pricing across different product categories.
Key Findings:
Most products are clustered within a specific price range.
Certain categories, such as electronics, tend to have higher average prices.
Modeling
The modeling process, outlined in 03_modeling.ipynb, included:

Model Selection: Implemented various models, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression, to predict prices or classify products.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Used RandomizedSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the models.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models based on metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared for regression tasks, and confusion matrices for classification tasks.
Installation

Usage
Open the 01_datacleaning.ipynb notebook to view the data cleaning process.
Proceed to 02_eda.ipynb to explore the data through various visualizations.
Finally, review 03_modeling.ipynb to understand the modeling process and results.
Results
The analysis revealed important trends in pricing data and developed predictive models with reasonable accuracy. Key results include:

A detailed understanding of how prices vary across different categories.
Predictive models that can estimate product prices based on features with an acceptable level of accuracy.
